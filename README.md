Golf GPS Range finder application using Nextion panel and Butterfly board with SD card option

This is a work in progress which takes a Nextion Panel and Butterfly board with SD card option to display GPS information.

A golf course is loaded on the SD card that is then loaded by the Butterfly board into memory and then displays information
about how far you are from a given hole on the golf course.  It also shows Par, Yards, and Handicap of each hole.

Parts so far:

Nextion Panel 4.3 inch
Butterfly board
SD card option
5 volt power regulator
1000mha 7.3 volt battery
Waveshare GPS
